# naivecrypt
Decryption toys for toy encryptions

A set of Lua scripts (with some BASH embedded) for decrypting simple letter substitution encryption schemes through letter frequency analysis.

Made exclusively for non serious uses, but feel free to use it for anything.
Even commercial stuff.
Just don't blame me for anything.

Peace.
